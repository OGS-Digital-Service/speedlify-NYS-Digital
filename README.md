# speedlify

After you make a fast web site, keep it fast by measuring it over time. Read [Use Speedlify to Continuously Measure Site Performance](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/). Created by [@zachleat](https://www.zachleat.com/).

* Requires Node 12+
* Each file in `_data/sites/*.js` is a category and contains a list of sites for comparison.

## Run locally

_After cloning you’ll probably want to delete the initial `_data/sites/*.js` files and create your own file with a list of your own site URLs!_

```
npm install
npm run test-pages
npm run start
```

## Build and deploy tests

- locally run npm build-production to generate tests and data
- push those commits and then pr to live 
- modified the netlify.toml to not build again as to not wipe out data
